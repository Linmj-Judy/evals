An ophthalmic examination consisting of a fundus evaluation and electroretinography (ERG) was completed, and small aliquots of blood were collected from all participating individuals.

An ophthalmic examination consisting of a fundus evaluation and electroretinography (ERG) was completed, and small aliquots of blood were collected from all participating individuals. Genomic DNA was extracted from white blood cells, and a genome-wide linkage or a locus-specific exclusion analysis was completed with polymorphic short tandem repeats (STRs). Two-point logarithm of odds (LOD) scores were calculated, and all coding exons and exon-intron boundaries of RP1 were sequenced to identify the causal mutation.\nRESULTS: The ophthalmic examination showed that affected individuals in all families manifest cardinal symptoms of RP. Genome-wide scans localized the disease phenotype to chromosome 8q, a region harboring RP1, a gene previously implicated in the pathogenesis of RP. Sanger sequencing identified a homozygous single base deletion in exon 4: c.3697delT (p.S1233Pfs22*), a single base substitution in intron 3: c.787+1G>A (p.I263Nfs8*), a 2 bp duplication in exon 2: c.551_552dupTA (p.Q185Yfs4*) and an 11,117 bp deletion that removes all three coding exons of RP1.

Dystrophinopathies show a complex mutation spectrum. The importance of mutation databases, with clinical phenotypes and protein studies of patients, is increasingly recognized as a reference for genetic diagnosis and for the development of gene therapy.\nMETHODS: We used the data from the Japanese Registry of Muscular Dystrophy (Remudy) compiled during from July 2009 to March 2017, and reviewed 1497 patients with dystrophinopathies.\nRESULTS: The spectrum of identified mutations contained exon deletions (61%), exon duplications (13%), nonsense mutations (13%), small deletions (5%), small insertions (3%), splice-site mutations (4%), and missense mutations (1%). Exon deletions were found most frequently in the central hot spot region between exons 45-52 (42%), and most duplications were detected in the proximal hot spot region between exons 3-25 (47%). In the 371 patients harboring a small mutation, 194 mutations were reported and 187 mutations were unreported.\nCONCLUSIONS: We report the largest dystrophinopathies mutation dataset in Japan from a national patient registry, \"Remudy\".

Here's what we can identify from your text:\n\n- **Molecular Entities**:\n  - **Disease**: Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), dystrophinopathies, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD)\n  - **Gene**: DMD gene\n\n- **Trigger Words**:\n  - **Variation (Var)**: mutations, exon deletions, exon duplications, nonsense mutations, small deletions, small insertions, splice-site mutations, missense mutations\n  - **Molecular Physiological Activity (MPA)**: (not explicitly mentioned, but implied through the context of gene mutations and their study)\n  - **Interaction, Pathway, Cell Physiological Activity (CPA), Regulation (Reg), Positive Regulation (PosReg), Negative Regulation (NegReg)**: These categories are not directly referenced in the text.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Semantic Role Labeling Objects\nSemantic roles, such as 'ThemeOf' and 'CauseOf', help us understand the relationships between entities. Based on the text:\n\n- **'ThemeOf'** might relate the mutations (as themes) to the diseases DMD and BMD (as the main thing entity).\n- **'CauseOf'** might relate the mutations in the DMD gene (as the cause) to the development of dystrophinopathies (as the effect).\n\n### Step 3: Formulate Triples\nNow, let's create triples that consist of entities and semantic role labeling objects.

Mortality results primarily from muscle wasting and cardiac arrhythmias. There are two forms of the disease: DM1 and DM2. DM1, which constitutes 98% of cases, is caused by a CTG expansion in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the DMPK gene. DM2 is caused by a CCTG expansion in the first intron of the ZNF9 gene. RNA containing CUG- or CCUG-expanded repeats are transcribed but are retained in the nucleus in foci. Disease pathogenesis results primarily from a gain of function of the expanded RNAs, which alter developmentally regulated alternative splicing as well as pathways of muscle differentiation. The toxic RNA has been implicated in sequestration of splicing regulators and transcription factors thereby causing specific symptoms of the disease. Here we review the proposed mechanisms for the toxic effects of the expanded repeats and discuss the molecular mechanisms of splicing misregulation and disease pathogenesis."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "\nBefore answering, reason in a step-by-step manner as to get the right answer, then conclude with the answer."}], "sampled": "In this semantic role recognition task, the goal is to analyze the text about myotonic dystrophy (DM) and extract entities and their semantic roles, and then form triples that represent these relationships.

(Toxic RNA, CauseOf, Sequestration of splicing regulators and transcription factors)\n6.

The incidence of BS is high in male vs. female (i.e., 8-10/1: male/female). The disorder is caused by mutations in the SCN5A gene encoding Nav1.5, the cardiac sodium channel, which is the only gene in which mutations were found to cause the disease. Mutations in SCN5A associated with the BS phenotype usually result in a loss of channel function by a reduction in Na+ currents. We review the clinical aspects, risk stratification, and therapeutic management of this important syndrome.\n\n************\n[Expert]: <SCN5A,ThemeOf,Mutations>,<Mutations,CauseOf,reduction>,<Na+ currents,ThemeOf,reduction>,<reduction,CauseOf,loss>,<channel function,ThemeOf,loss>,<loss,CauseOf,BS>\n************\n[Submission]: 1. **(Brugada syndrome, ThemeOf, mutations in SCN5A)**\n2. **(Mutations in SCN5A, CauseOf, loss of channel function)**\n3. **(Loss of channel function, CauseOf, reduction in Na+ currents)**\n\nThese triples concisely capture the essence of the relationships among the entities related to Brugada syndrome, focusing on the genetic basis of the disorder and its physiological effects.
