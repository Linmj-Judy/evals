    instructions: |
      Please give a complete list of SMILES structures and physical properties of all molecules in the paper.
      1. Find all the tables with relevant information
      2. Output in csv format. Quote the value if it has comma! For example:
      ```csv
      Compound,Name,SMILES,Properties_1,Properties_2,Properties_3,Properties_4
      "5a","Aspirin","CC(=O)Oc1ccccc1C(=O)O",2.0 nM,8.0 nM,12.6 nM,>1000 nM
      ```
      3. If there are multiple tables, concat them. Don't give me reference or using "...", give me complete table!
