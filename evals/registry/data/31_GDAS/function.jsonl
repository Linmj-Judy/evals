Its clinical and genetic diagnosis is crucial for cardiac management and genetic counselling. Seven LMNA mutations have been previously reported to be responsible for LGMD1B.\nPATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe the neurological and cardiologic features of 14 patients belonging to 8 families in whom we identified 6 different LMNA mutations, 4 of them having never been reported. Results. Eleven patients had an LGMD1B phenotype with scapulohumeral and pelvic-femoral involvement. Thirteen patients had cardiac disease associating conduction defects (12 patients) or arrhythmias (9 patients). Seven patients needed cardiac device (pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator) and two had heart transplantation.\nCONCLUSION: This study allowed us to specify the clinical characteristics of this entity and to outline the first phenotype/genotype relations resulting from these observations."}], "ideal": "(LMMA, REG, Limb girdle muscular dystrophy type 1b)"}

Primarily, mutations in LMNA have been associated to the autosomal forms of Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, a rare slowly progressive humero-peroneal muscular dystrophy accompanied by early contractures and dilated cardiomyopathy with conduction defects. LMNA mutations have been reported to be responsible for up to 10 distinct phenotypes that affect specifically either the skeletal and/or cardiac muscle, the adipose tissue, the peripheral nervous tissue, the bone tissue or more recently premature ageing. So far more than 180 different LMNA mutations have been identified in 903 individuals. The first studies of phenotype/genotype relationships revealed no dear relation between the phenotype and the type and/or the localization of the mutation, except perhaps for the globular tail domain of lamins A/C. Studies of the consequences of LMNA mutations in the skin cultured fibroblasts from the patients reveal abnormal nuclei in variable proportions, with dysmorphic nuclei exhibiting abnormal patterns of expression of B-type lamins and emerin. Finally, the development of KO and KI LMNA mice, will certainly give further insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms associated with LMNA mutations.

It has been shown that the disease is caused by cathepsin C gene (CTSC) mutation leading to the deficiency of cathepsin C enzymatic activity. This study demonstrates the clinical manifestations and CTSC mutational and enzymatic activity analyses in a 5-year-old Thai male PLS patient and his parents.\nMETHODS: Peripheral blood samples were obtained for genomic DNA isolation. All exons of the CTSC gene were amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers. Mutations were identified by DNA sequencing. Verification of the mutation was performed by digestion of PCR products by restriction endonucleases. The cathepsin C enzymatic activity was determined using the synthetic substrate glycyl- L-arginine-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin.\nRESULTS: The patient demonstrated classical characteristics of PLS, including hyperkeratotic skin lesions. By the age of 5, all of his primary teeth were extracted due to severe periodontal infection. The parents had no physical abnormalities. The periodontal examination revealed localized mild periodontal destruction. Sequence analysis showed a nucleotide change at position 90 from C >A (c.90C >A) which resulted in a change from cysteine residue to a premature stop codon at the amino acid position 30 in the exon 1. The HpyCH4V digestion revealed that the patient was homozygous, whereas both the father and mother were heterozygous carriers of this mutation. The cathepsin C activity was reduced in the patient's mother, and the activity in the patient was almost completely lost.\nCONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate a CTSC gene mutation in a Thai family with PLS. The identified mutation is novel and potentially leads to the drastic reduction of the cathepsin C enzymatic activity. This suggests that the mutation is pathogenetic, causing the PLS. Mutational analysis in more members of the family is warranted to identify whether the mutation is inherited from a common ancestor."}], "ideal": "(CTSC, LOF, Papillon-Lefevre syndrome)"}

Children affected with this disease tend to develop normally for the first 5 years of life. However, once disease onset occurs, they decline rapidly and die in their late 20s to early 30s. Though this represents the typical disease course, the onset and severity of disease symptoms can vary. This variability is presumed to be the result of both differences in the causative genetic mutation in the CLN3 gene as well as environmental influences. Most cases of JNCL are caused by a 1 kb deletion in the CLN3 gene, resulting in a frameshift mutation predicted to leave the first 153 amino acids of the CLN3 protein intact, followed by the addition of 28 novel amino acids. Here we report the discovery of a novel mutation identified as a G to T transversion at nucleotide 49 (G49T) in exon 2 of CLN3, introducing a premature stop codon (E17X) near the N-terminus. This mutation represents the most 5' mutation described to date. The patient examined in this study was heterozygous for the common 1 kb deletion and E17X.

It is genetically heterogeneous, showing linkage to three X chromosomal loci. CORDX1 is caused by mutations in the RPGR gene (Xp21.1), CORDX2 is located on Xq27.2-28, and we recently localised CORDX3 to Xp11.4-q13.1. We aimed to identify the causative gene behind the CORDX3 phenotype.\nMETHODS: All 48 exons of the CACNA1F gene were screened for mutations by DNA sequencing. RNA from cultured lymphoblasts and peripheral blood activated T lymphocytes was analysed by RT-PCR and sequencing.\nRESULTS: A novel CACNA1F mutation, IVS28-1 GCGTC>TGG, in the splice acceptor site of intron 28 was identified. Messenger RNA studies indicated that the identified mutation leads to altered splicing of the CACNA1F transcript. Aberrant splice variants are predicted to result in premature termination and deletions of the encoded protein, Ca(v)1.4 alpha1 subunit.\nCONCLUSION: CACNA1F mutations cause the retinal disorder, incomplete congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB2), although mutations have also been detected in patients with divergent diagnoses. Our results indicate that yet another phenotype, CORDX3, is caused by a mutation in CACNA1F. Clinically, CORDX3 shares some features with CSNB2 but is distinguishable from CSNB2 in that it is progressive, can begin in adulthood, has no nystagmus or hyperopic refraction, has only low grade astigmatism, and in dark adaptation lacks cone threshold and has small or no elevation of rod threshold. Considering all features, CORDX3 is more similar to other X chromosomal cone-rod dystrophies than to CSNB2."}], "ideal": "(CACNA1F, REG, X linked cone-rod dystrophy), (CACNA1F, REG, congenital stationary night blindness), (RPGR, REG, X linked cone-rod dystrophy)"}

In addition to SLAM, SAP associates with several other cell-surface receptors including 2B4 (CD244), Ly9 (CD229), CD84 and NTB-A. SAP contains a single src-homology-2 domain and acts as an intracellular adaptor protein by recruiting the protein tyrosine kinase FynT to the cytoplasmic domains of some of these receptors, which results in the initiation of specific downstream signal transduction pathways. XLP is likely to result from perturbed signalling through one or more of these SAP-associating receptors. In this study, we identified missense (Y54C, I84T and F87S) and insertion (fs82 --> X103) mutations in four different kindreds affected by XLP. Each mutation dramatically reduced the half-life of SAP, thus diminishing its expression in primary lymphocytes as well as in transfected cell lines. Interestingly, although the Y54C and F87S mutations compromised the ability of SAP to associate with different receptors, the I84T mutation had no effect on the ability of SAP to bind SLAM, CD84 or 2B4. However, signalling downstream of SLAM was reduced in the presence of SAP bearing the I84T mutation. These findings indicate that, irrespective of the type of mutation, signalling through SAP-associating receptors in XLP can be impaired by reducing the expression of SAP, the ability of SAP to bind surface receptors and/or its ability to activate signal transduction downstream of the SLAM-SAP complex."}], "ideal": "(SH2D1A, LOF, X-linked lymphoproliferative disease)"}

Minimum criteria for inclusion in the adRP cohort included either evidence of at least three generations of affected individuals or two generations with evidence of male-to-male transmission. Probands from each family were screened for mutations in 13 genes known to cause adRP: CA4, CRX, FSCN2, IMPDH1, NRL, PRPF3 (RP18), PRPF8 (RP13), PRPF31 (RP11), RDS, RHO, ROM1, RP1, and RP9. Families without mutations in autosomal genes and in which an X-linked mode of inheritance could not be excluded were tested for mutations in ORF 15 of X-linked RPGR. Potentially pathogenic variants were evaluated based on a variety of genetic and computational criteria, to confirm or exclude pathogenicity.\nRESULTS: A total of 82 distinct, rare (nonpolymorphic) variants were detected among the genes tested. Of these, 57 are clearly pathogenic based on multiple criteria, 10 are probably pathogenic, and 15 are probably benign. In the cohort of 200 families, 94 (47%) have one of the clearly pathogenic variants and 10 (5%) have one of the probably pathogenic variants. One family (0.5%) has digenic RDS-ROM1 mutations. Two families (1%) have a pathogenic RPGR mutation, indicating that families with apparent autosomal transmission of RP may actually have X-linked genetic disease. Thus, 107 families (53.5%) have mutations in known genes, leaving 93 whose underlying cause is still unknown.\nCONCLUSIONS: Together, the known adRP genes account for retinal disease in approximately half of the families in this survey, mostly Americans of European origin. Among the adRP genes, IMPDH1, PRPF8, PRPF31, RDS, RHO, and RP1 each accounts for more than 2% of the total; CRX, PRPF3, and RPGR each accounts for roughly 1%.

It is normally present in two forms, a full-length form B and an N-terminal truncated form A with still unknown function. Mutations in the AR gene cause androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), which is divided into subgroups according to the degree of undermasculinization. Patients with completely female external genitalia are classified as complete AIS (CAIS). However, a recent study has shown that some CAIS patients have signs of internal male genital differentiation due to missense mutations that show some degree of residual function.\nOBJECTIVE: We aimed to study the expression of the different forms of the AR in two CAIS patients in relation to the development of male internal genital structures. One patient had a mutation (L7fsX33) that affects only the full-length AR-B form of the AR, whereas the other had a nonsense mutation (Q733X) affecting both isoforms.\nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: We thoroughly analysed internal genitalia at surgery and by histological examination. No signs of Wolffian duct (WD) development were present in any of the patients. Western blotting of proteins from gonadal and genital skin fibroblasts was performed with AR antibodies directed against different AR epitopes. The N-terminally truncated A form was expressed in normal amounts in the patient with the L7fsX33 mutation while no AR was detected in the other patient.\nCONCLUSION: The presence of the AR-A form does not seem to be sufficient for WD maintenance and differentiation."}], "ideal": "(AR, REG, androgen insensitivity syndrome)"}

Further, telomere fluorescence in situ hybridization indicates that the abnormal signals, extra telomere signal and loss of telomere signal, emerge two- to three-fold more frequently in WS cells than in normal cells.

The increased accumulation of DSBs in WS cells is reduced in the presence of anti-oxidative agents, suggesting that enhanced oxidative stress in WS cells is involved in accelerated accumulation of DSBs.

The purpose of this study was, by examining the electrophysiological responses of the retina, to evaluate the capacity of recovery of the whole retinal area and different cell types induced by extremely prolonged dark adaptation (DA) in BD disease and to gain further understanding of the pathogenesis of BD. Six young patients underwent bilateral full-field ERGs after 24 h of DA in one eye and standard DA in the fellow eye. The results were also compared with the effect of prolonged DA (10 h), previously studied in the same patients. After extremely prolonged DA (24 h) the rod b-wave and the mixed rod-cone a-wave responses reached normal though delayed amplitudes. An increase, up to normal level, in the oscillatory response was found. There was no obvious recovery of the cone response. We conclude that in young BD patients during extremely prolonged DA there is a significant additional capacity of recovery of rod function and also significant gain of activity in the inner retinal layer.

Mutations are mainly truncating mutations or deletions, missense mutations having been reported in few cases. An important phenotypic variability is observed among gene carriers. To assess whether the phenotypic variability of neurofibromatosis 2 could be linked to genotype, clinical data of 154 patients whose NF2 germline alteration had been identified in our laboratory have been collected.\nMETHODS: A retrospective questionnaire was sent to the physicians in charge of these patients. Statistical analyses regarding genotypic and phenotypic data were performed by comparisons of average values and correlation tests.\nRESULTS: In French patients, type of mutation was correlated neither with patients' sex, nor with disease occurrence mode (de novo or inherited mutation). Disease associated with missense mutations occurred later, with a less severe symptomatology. Patients with nonsense or frameshift mutations were more frequently affected with meningiomas and spinal tumours, in addition to VIII nerve schwannomas, an observation that underlies the genetic determination of the number and type of NF2-related tumours.\nCONCLUSION: Results from the literature as well as from our study tend to show that only few correlations exist between genotype and phenotype in the NF2 disease. It also recognizes that missense mutations have a lower level of evolution, severity and mortality risk. Nonsense and frameshift mutations seem to be associated with a higher number of meningiomas and spinal tumours. Therefore, NF2 gene screening keeps its indications in both typical and moderate forms of the disease. Mutations are responsible of 80 p.cent of typical forms; in moderate forms, identification of a missense mutation seems linked to a lower disease evolution. In any case, assessment and supervision should be identical. Finally, in a small number of cases, the NF2 gene appears to be implicated in clinical forms different from those defined by NIH and it might be of interest to enlarge the clinical features suggestive of the disease."}], "ideal": "(NF2, REG, neurofibromatosis type 2), (nan, nan, nan)"}

Among these diseases, hereditary periodic fevers (HPFs) are Mendelian disorders associated with sequence variations in very few genes; these variations are mostly missense mutations whose deleterious effect, which is particularly difficult to assess, is often questionable. The growing number of identified sporadic cases of periodic fever syndrome, together with the lack of discriminatory clinical criteria, has greatly hampered the identification of new disease-causing genes, a step that is, however, essential for appropriate management of these disorders. Using a candidate gene approach, we identified nonambiguous mutations in NALP12 (i.e., nonsense and splice site) in two families with periodic fever syndromes. As shown by means of functional studies, these two NALP12 mutations have a deleterious effect on NF-kappaB signaling. Overall, these data identify a group of HPFs defined by molecular defects in NALP12, opening up new ways to manage these disorders.

Cardiomyopathy, neuropathy, and dominant inheritance are frequent associated features. Mutations in alphaB-crystallin, desmin, myotilin, Zasp, or filamin-C can cause MFMs and were detected in 32 of 85 patients of the Mayo MFM cohort.

Neuromyotonic discharges were not influenced by general anesthesia and disappeared with curare administration. They persisted after complete motor nerve section, terminating only with Wallerian degeneration. These results demonstrate that perlecan deficiency in SJS provokes a neuromyotonic syndrome.

The association of mutation carriage with a personal history of FMF-like phenomena, as well as various inflammatory and non-inflammatory diseases, was evaluated. A high MEFV mutation frequency was found among Jews of Bucharian, Georgian and Bulgarian origin (20%), whereas intermediate and low rates were detected in Jews of Turkish and Yemenite extraction (14 and 8%, respectively). FMF-like manifestations and related diseases were observed more often in MEFV mutation carriers than in their counterparts.

Selected confocal images of corneal layers were evaluated qualitatively for shape and degree of light reflection of deposits.\nRESULTS: Novel mutations in the UBIAD1 gene (Y174C, K181R, and N233H) were identified. Additionally, cosegregation of the mutation (Y174C) and SCCD was confirmed in 1 pedigree, indicating that the mutation of the UBIAD1 gene is causative for SCCD. The 3 mutations were absent in all 200 control chromosomes. In vivo laser confocal microscopy demonstrated subepithelial highly reflective crystals in 4 cases; the shapes of the crystals were needle-shaped (3 cases) or rectangular (1 case). A phenotype and genotype correlation was demonstrated in 1 pedigree, and phenotypic heterogeneity (SCCD with or without crystals caused by a same mutation of Y174C in the UBIAD1 gene) also was demonstrated in 1 pedigree.\nCONCLUSIONS: Nonsynonymous novel mutations in the UBIAD1 gene were detected in 3 unrelated Japanese pedigrees with SCCD, confirming the genetic heterogeneity of this disorder. In vivo laser confocal microscopy is capable of identifying characteristic corneal microstructural changes related to genetically mapped SCCD with high resolution, and phenotypic heterogeneity was presented. Further confocal and mutational analysis using a larger number of patients with SCCD is required to elucidate in vivo microstructural phenotype and genotype correlations.\nFINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): The author(s) have no proprietary or commercial interest in any materials discussed in this article."}], "ideal": "(UBIAD1, REG, Schnyder's crystalline corneal dystrophy)"}

Cases of dominant inheritance and phenotype-genotype heterogeneity have been reported; however, the underlying molecular mechanism is not currently understood. The FMF protein named pyrin or marenostrin (P/M) is thought to be involved in regulating innate immunity but its function remains subject to controversy. Recent studies postulate that a defect in MEFV expression regulation may play a role in FMF physiopathology. Our group, along with others, has identified several alternatively spliced MEFV transcripts in leukocytes. Since alternative splicing and nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathways are usually coupled in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, we hypothesized that NMD could contribute to the regulation of the MEFV gene. To address this issue, we examined the effect of indirect and direct inhibition of NMD on expression of the MEFV transcripts in THP1, monocyte and neutrophil cells. We showed that MEFV is the first auto-inflammatory gene regulated by NMD in both a cell- and transcript-specific manner. These results and preliminary western-blot analyses suggest the possible translation of alternatively spliced MEFV transcripts into several P/M variants according to cell type and inflammatory state. Our results introduce the novel hypothesis that variation of NMD efficiency could play an important role in FMF physiopathology as a potent phenotypic modifier."}], "ideal": "(MEFV, REG, familial Mediterranean feve)"}

Recently it was shown that the vast majority of patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II carry mutations in the SEC23B gene. Here we established the molecular basis of 42 cases of congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II and attempted to define a genotype-phenotype relationship.\nDESIGN AND METHODS: SEC23B gene sequencing analysis was performed to assess the diversity and incidence of each mutation in 42 patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II (25 described exclusively in this work), from the Italian and the French Registries, and the relationship of these mutations with the clinical presentation. To this purpose, we divided the patients into two groups: (i) patients with two missense mutations and (ii) patients with one nonsense and one missense mutation.\nRESULTS: We found 22 mutations of uneven frequency, including seven novel mutations. Compound heterozygosity for a missense and a nonsense mutation tended to produce a more severe clinical presentation, a lower reticulocyte count, a higher serum ferritin level, and, in some cases, more pronounced transfusion needs, than homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for two missense mutations. Homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for two nonsense mutations was never found.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study allowed us to determine the most frequent mutations in patients with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia type II.

In humans, PAX6 is located in chromosome 11p13, and its mutations lead to a variety of hereditary ocular malformations of the anterior and posterior segment, among which aniridia and most probably foveal hypoplasia are the major signs. Aniridia occurs due to decreased dosage of the PAX6 gene and exists in both sporadic and familial forms. The mutations are scattered throughout the gene and the vast majority of those reported so far are nonsense mutations, frameshift mutations, or splicing errors that are predicted to cause pre-mature truncation of the PAX6 protein, causing haploinsufficiency. Here we review the data regarding the mechanisms and the mutations that relate to aniridia."}], "ideal": "(PAX6, LOF, Aniridia)"}

The mutations are distributed throughout the protein in multiple functional domains. In biochemical and cell culture experiments, some mutant forms of GARS have been indistinguishable from wild-type protein, suggesting that these in vitro tests might not adequately assess the aberrant activity responsible for axonal degeneration. Recently, mouse and fly models have offered new insights into the disease mechanism. There are still gaps in our understanding of how mutations in a ubiquitously expressed component of the translation machinery result in axonal neuropathy. Here, we review recent reports, weigh the evidence for and against possible mechanisms and suggest areas of focus for future work."}], "ideal": "(GARS, REG, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2D)"}

Thirty-three patients had absence of merosin and 13 showed some residual merosin. Compared to the residual merosin group, patients with absent merosin had an earlier presentation (<7days) (P=0.0073), were more likely to lack independent ambulation (P=0.0215), or require enteral feeding (P=0.0099) and ventilatory support (P=0.0354). We identified 33 novel LAMA2 mutations; these were distributed throughout the gene in patients with absent merosin, with minor clusters in exon 27, 14, 25 and 26 (55% of mutations). Patients with residual merosin often carried at least one splice site mutation and less frequently frameshift mutations.

Mutations in the filaggrin gene (FLG) have recently been identified as the cause of IV. However, there have been no reports of FLG mutations in mainland Chinese families with IV.\nOBJECTIVES: To identify FLG mutations in Chinese patients with IV.\nMETHODS: Eleven unrelated Chinese families with IV were examined for FLG mutations with denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography prescreening and sequencing. SNaPShot was employed to obtain a high-throughput screening for the identified mutations.\nRESULTS: Three mutations - one novel mutation (Q1256X) and two known mutations (3321delA and E2422X) - were identified in these families. The novel mutation, Q1256X, found in a Chinese family with IV, was located in filaggrin repeat 3. Mutation 3321delA, previously found in Japanese patients, was present in eight Chinese families with IV. Mutation E2422X, previously found in a Dutch patient of Chinese origin, was present in two Chinese families with IV. Neither of the null mutations, Q1256X and E2422X, were found in 100 unrelated control cases from the Chinese population; however, the mutation ratio for 3321delA was 3% in these controls.\nCONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that each population may have a unique and prevalent set of FLG mutations."}], "ideal": "(FLG, REG, Ichthyosis vulgaris)"}

Identification of these mutations is becoming increasingly important in a variety of clinical settings. The purpose of this report is to describe our experience of FVIII gene mutation analysis in the largest cohort of patients in Taiwan including the discovery of 21 novel mutations. We tested 115 HA patients from 91 unrelated families, including 79 severe, 15 moderate and 21 mild types starting with an assay for the intron 22 inversion by long range-PCR followed if necessary by additional genetic studies. Intron 22 inversion accounted for 27.8% of the total and 36.7% of severe HA patients respectively while intron 1 inversion comprised 7.6% of severe patients. These were clearly different from the known data in caucasian populations. Of 75 patients without intron 22 or 1 inversion, 70 from 62 unrelated families revealed 56 different mutations by denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC), of which 21 were novel. Also, the only female patient with severe HA was found to have heterozygous non-sense mutation (c.6683G>A) of exon 24. Seven patients, including five without amplified PCR product and two without encoded DNA defect turned out to have exon(s) deletion or insertion by reverse transcript PCR (RT-PCR). In our study, the combination of various molecular techniques including LR-PCR, multiplex PCR, DHPLC and RT-PCR analysis enabled definitive detection of the causative FVIII gene defects in 112 of 113 (99%) HA patients."}], "ideal": "(FVIII, REG, Haemophilia A)"}
